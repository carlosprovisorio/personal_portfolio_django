# The code snippet is setting up a URL pattern in a Django project. It is importing the `path`
# function from `django.urls` module and the `views` module from a local `pages` package. The
# `urlpatterns` list is then defined with a single URL pattern that maps the root URL to the `home`
# view function. This means that when a user visits the root URL of the website, the `home` view
# function from the `views` module in the `pages` package will be executed.
